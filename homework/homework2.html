Common HTML Tags:
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;br&gt;: The br tag inserts a single line break.The br tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.The br tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.</li>
        <li> &lt;body&gt;: The <body> tag defines the document's body.
            The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            Note: There can only be one body element in an HTML document.</li>
        <li> &lt;p&gt;: The p tag defines a paragraph.
            Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each p element.</li>
        <li> &lt;ul&gt;: The ul tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list.
            Use the ul tag together with the li tag to create unordered lists.</li>
        <li> &lt;ol&gt;: The ol tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical.
            The li tag is used to define each list item.</li>
        <li> &lt;li&gt;: The li tag defines a list item.
            The li tag is used inside ordered lists(ol), unordered lists (ul), and in menu lists (menu).
            In ul and menu, the list items will usually be displayed with bullet points.
            In ol, the list items will usually be displayed with numbers or letters.</li>
        <li> &lt;a href&gt;: The a tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
            The most important attribute of the a element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. For example <a href="https://pbs.org">I love PBS.org</a></li>
        <li> &lt;img&gt;: The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.
            Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
            The img tag has two required attributes: <br>
             src - Specifies the path to the image <br>
             alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed</li>
        <li> &lt;strong&gt;: The strong tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in <strong>bold</strong>.</li>
        <li>nbsp: A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space. <strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong></li>
      
    </ul>
